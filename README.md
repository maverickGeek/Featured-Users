# Featured Users

Allows the administrator to make users featured. All it does is give the user a custom meta field called `jsfeatured_user`. Now available are a shortcode, widget, filters, and theme functions.

## Description

While working on a custom WordPress theme we needed the ability to feature users and authors. So we created the ‘Featured users’ plugin which allows the administrator to easily star (feature) users. Then using a custom query in the theme, shortcode or widget; featured users can be displayed by only retrieving users with the custom user meta `jsfeatured_user`. The plugin does not make any changes to your current theme it only does the following:

* Adds a featured column in the Users panel of the WordPress Admin
* When a user is featured the plugin adds or updates the custom field ‘jsfeatured_user’ and sets the value to yes.
* Provides custom widget that echoes out shortcode.
* Provides custom shortcode that echoes ul list of featured users.
* Includes theme functions and filters for developers.

Feel free to use and include in your WordPress Installs, please think of us if you need a custom theme or plugin developed! Use documented code examples on the settings page to modify the expected output.
